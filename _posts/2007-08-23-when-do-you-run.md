It is not the final marathon run that you earn. It is the process that you go through to achieve it. You encounter problems, excuses and road blocks; every turn, but then you learn on how to eliminate them or steer around them is wonderful. Again, the final destination is not what matters, but the path you ran that led you there does.<br><br>I am sure every one who is a runner has their own experiences as I have my own. One of my prominent problems is the lack of time. Presently, I work in the New York city and live in Princeton area. Each commute is 1.5 hours to 2 hours one way. That takes away a good 3 hours; then I have to work 8 hours to justify my paycheck. Upon this are conditions that I can't run until 3 hours after a meal. And finally I need to sleep for 6 hours. You do that math. Including misc hours, I am left with not many opportunities to practice my runs. So I wanted to share my situation with<span style="font-weight: bold;"> you folks and gather some ideas on what you would do if you were in my situation. Please talk back to me and tell me what you think? </span>(on the left is I charted on when I run)<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><br>Sometimes it is hard for me, not because it is physically hard, optimizing time and juggling the schedule is hard. I thought of quitting it but then something made me keep going. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What do you think ? Shall I quit ? </span><br><br>It appeared to me that there were lot of that were working against me. To name few,<br><ol><li>Initial few weeks; I would run out of breath and could not run; I would blame it on damn lungs.</li><li>Then; it was; that I would run out of steam; blame it on the carbs I din't have. </li><li>Then it was that I got hurt on the track was a reason; I couldn't limp and run.<br></li><li>Later it my friend's wedding I had attend, I din't wanted to run :-)<br></li><li>Sometimes I was blaming it on the rain.</li></ol>In my two and half months of running practice; all the permutations and combinations of above reasons was scheming against  my run. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But I am still running. Please share with me what would make you run and when will you do it.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;"></div>

How many times we question - why are we doing what we are doing?

Well...I would try to minimize the impact of the miscellaneous hours on the busy days so you are able to always get in the running highs =)  Try to plan out food schedule for the week - have meals ready for quick heating or eat right before your commute home so the 3 hours is halfway over by the time you get back.  Send out laundry, make lists of to-do &amp; for shopping when you think of it so you don't have to go back &amp; remember what you needed.  And above all - try to smile as much as possible =)

Also...when the excuses to not run start coming in...call someone.  Tell them you are struggling &amp; need a push  &amp; they will help you remember why it is that you really do want to run.  &amp; soon enough you'll be out there forgetting all of the excuses...
